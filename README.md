This repository includes two PPV-based HIFU thalamotomy target maps, generated and distributed in MNI ICBM 152 Nonlinear atlas (version 2009) space:

	1.	PPV_Joint_Map_Binarized.nii: a binarized PPV-derived target mask
	
	2.	PPV_Joint_Map_NonBinarized.nii: a continuous-valued PPV joint map, in which each voxel’s intensity corresponds to the joint PPV value
